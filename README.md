# mp3-player-with-DB


update 07-21-2020

Trying to make a mp3 player with a mixture of pygame and tkinter.
When That begins to work locally I'll try to make it get the playlist over NySQL
Going to rewrite the whole code tomorrow.. Well later today it's 3 in the morning.

Well done with most of what i had deleted. still missing
- scale volume adjusment
- proper grid for buttons
- images for buttons

Another thing I did since I had to do it anyway was work with classes methods etc. 
Good additional practice since i'm learning anyways.

All that contain pygame is moved to module music_setup.py and then imported to
main.py where teh different methods is called as needed. So far looks better
but don't know if it is the best it can be.
Trying to focus a lot on good coding practices.
